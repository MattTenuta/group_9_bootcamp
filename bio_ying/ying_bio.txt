Hi, I am Ying Yang. In the Astro Digital, my responsibility is dealing with the coding, such as JS and CSS. I am studying level 3 IDP at Fanshawe College. 
                    I have experienced on making videos and wedding design. I am so interested in studing coding and motion design. I also likes watching dramas and cooking. 
                    After I gradute from Fanshawe, I will apply a higher degree that is relative with media. I want to be a motion designer if I want to find a job in Ontario. And I have a long experience in Marketing so I think I will be grew up in the media field.
