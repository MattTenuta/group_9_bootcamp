Heading : Front-End Developer / UX Designer
Hi Ya'll. I am Immama. As you might have seen from the above heading, I am a designer and a developer too. I specialize in understanding Astro Digital's clients problems, designing a human-centered design for them, prototype it and help in coding it. As a UX designer and Front-End developer, it is my duty to provide our clients the results and solutions they always have wished for. With experise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I strive to give life to design that I have made for our clients at Astro. 
Graduating at Fanshawe College with advanced diploma in Interactive Media Development - 3D Visualization, I always wished to work for a company that values people's dreamms, emotions and help them build it(in this case websites, marketing solutions). By working at Astro Digital, I feel good and can also see my own wish come true.
