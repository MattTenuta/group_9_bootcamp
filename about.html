                            Hello, my name is Matthew Tenuta and I am the Head Graphic Designer at Astro Digital. Our main goal at Astro Digital is to help grow your company into something which reflects your values and you can be proud of. As the Head Graphic Designer, it is my responsibility to visualize and create graphics as well as other media you need. I have experience with front end development as I provided some HTML for our Astro Digital website. I am currently a second year student in the Fanshawe College interactive media design program, and after graduating I hope to obtain a job related to graphic design/video editing. I work hard and try my best in any project I work on whether individual or a group project. I had a lot of fun working with my colleagues on this project and I hope to learn and create more in the future.
